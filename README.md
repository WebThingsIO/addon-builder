# Add-on builder

Add-on builder for the Mozilla WebThings Gateway.

This repository will build addons for macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi variants
of the gateway.

Use the `trigger-build.py` script to initiate a build. Modifying
any of the files in this repository and pushing them will also
trigger a build of all of the adapters.

# `trigger-build.py`

The `trigger-build.py` will trigger a GitHub workflow to start
building an image. You can check the progress by watching
https://github.com/mozilla-iot/addon-builder/actions

If you only want to build for one adapter, you can pass that adapter on
the command line.
```
./trigger-build.py --token <your-token> gpio-adapter
```

# Deployed tarballs

The tarballs that are built will be deployed to mozilla-gateway-addons AWS bucket.
URLs to the addons will be printed at the end of the job. You can
also view all of the addons by using:
```
aws s3 ls s3://mozilla-gateway-addons/
```
or
```
aws s3 ls s3://mozilla-gateway-addons/builder/
```
to view the addons which have been built (but not yet deployed).
